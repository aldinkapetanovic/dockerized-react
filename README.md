# Dockerized React

```sh
npx create-react-app dockerized-react
```

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  ```sh
  npm start
  ```
Starts the development server.

  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```
Bundles the app into static files for production.

  ```sh
  npm test
  ```
Starts the test runner.

  ```sh
  npm run eject
  ```
Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  ```sh
  cd dockerized-react
  npm start
  ```

Happy hacking!
